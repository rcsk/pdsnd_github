### Project Title
*Explore US Bikeshare Date with Python*

### Description
"In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote Python code to import that data and answer interesting questions about it using PANDAS and descriptive statistics. Additionally, I wrote a script that took in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal for presentation" (Udacity Overview, 2019).
